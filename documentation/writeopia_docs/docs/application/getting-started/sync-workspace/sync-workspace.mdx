# Sync
You can sync your files locally by selecting a folder on your computer. To do this, go to Settings > Directory, choose your local folder.

<ReactPlayer 
    playing={false} 
    controls url="https://storage.googleapis.com/writeopia-resources/docusaurus/configure_workspace.mov" 
    width="100%"       
    height="600px" />

## Saving documents
You can manually save your workspace locally by clicking the save icon. Your documents will be stored on your computer. If a saved document has a newer last-updated date, it wonâ€™t be overwritten, as the latest version always takes precedence in Writeopia.

## Syncing documents
Clicking the sync icon (a circular arrow symbol) will synchronize all files. Documents on the computer will be imported, while those in Writeopia will be saved locally. If a document exists in both locations, the newer version will take precedence.
