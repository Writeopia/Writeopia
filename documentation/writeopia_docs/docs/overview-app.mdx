# Overview - App

Writeopia is a component to add rich text editors inside apps using Kotlin. This SDK aims to be a platform to create a text edition from end to end. It provides components both for the backend and mobile so developers create both the UI and data for text editors.

The editor uses a simple core and each part of the editor can be configured independently like list items, headers, titles, and images.
