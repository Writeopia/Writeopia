Writeopia comes with a plugin to allow exporting information in some formats, like Markdown. You can add the `export` library.

```kotlin
implementation("io.writeopia:writeopia-export:[version]") in next version
```

You can export a document to markdown with the following code: 

```kotlin
private fun documentToMd(document: Document): String =
    DocumentToMarkdown.parse(document.content)
```
