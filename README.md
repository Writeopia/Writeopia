This is the source code for Writopia, a text editing App and SDK.

# Application
Writeopia is a modern text editor that integrates AI while prioritizing offline functionality and user privacy. Unlike cloud-based AI assistants, Writeopia allows you to choose your own AI model and interact with it locally, ensuring that your data stays on your device.

## Why Writeopia?
Writeopia is built for writers, developers, and researchers who want the power of AI without sacrificing privacy. Whether you're drafting a novel, taking notes, or coding, Writeopia provides an intelligent and distraction-free environment.
